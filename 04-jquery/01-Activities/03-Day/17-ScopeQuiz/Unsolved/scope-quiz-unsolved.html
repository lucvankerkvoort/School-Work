      // 1. What is the difference (in output) between Situation 1 and Situation 2?
      // 2. Why are the alert messages different? (Hint: Look for syntax differences)

      // Situation 1
      // ------------------------------------------

      function a1() {
        myVar1 = 5 - 3;

      // What happens here is that the variable MyVar1 gets manipulated inside of the function.
      // This means that we change the value of it. Which causes myVar1 to have a different outcome then the original hence being logged by both functions.

      // Situation 2
      // ------------------------------------------
      var myVar2 = 1;

      function a2() {
        var myVar2 = 5 - 3;

      // Here myVar2 gets created twice. Function a2 creates a new variable named myVar2 but because we execute the function b2 first, b2 takes the initial myVar2 and logs 1
      // inside function a2 the newly created myvar gets logged by the alert inside function a2
